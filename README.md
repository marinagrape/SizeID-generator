# SizeID-generator

All you need is to run the program (Python)
This program is simply generating the Size ID for the user. 
We first ask the user to enter the length of Size ID between 3 to 6 characters. 
Then we shuffle characters randomly and printing them out. 
After that we call the function. 
We also want to make sure the user knows the date when the size id expires. We print out today's date and the date when the size id expires (exactly in 60 days).
